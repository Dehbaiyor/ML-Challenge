# ML-Challenge
SPEUI ML Challenge

This solution was created to detect theft from Oil pipelines using the combination of an intelligent model (Gradient Boosting) and interactive plotting to detect unusual periodicity in the transients of the oil pipeline operations.

The model was created to work in batch mode. To use the model, one is just required to provide a test sample input as shown in the jupyter note.
